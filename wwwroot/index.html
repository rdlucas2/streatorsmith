    <h1>Streator Smith 2021 Competition Video Submission Form</h1>
    <h4>Checklist</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To ensure fairness, we ask that you not identify yourself by name in the video or the video file name. There is no need to address the judge.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only submit ONE VIDEO with BOTH PIECES played back to back. This is the closest experience to an in-person audition.
        </li>
        <li>
            Please wear appropriate performance attire and shoes for the video.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure that the performer is in the shot while filming. The judge would like to get a look at your technique, so make sure to capture your hands and head!
        </li>
        <li>
            The name of the file does not matter, but as stated above do not include your name. The default name generated by your recording device, or a format such as "contestant#.ext" - for example, if you are contestant 2, "contestant2.mov" - will do.
        </li>
        <li>
            Video is one of these formats: ".MP4", ".WEBM", ".MPG", ".MP2", ".MPEG", ".MPE", ".MPV", ".OGG", ".M4P", ".M4V", ".AVI", ".WMV", ".MOV", ".QT", ".FLV", ".SWF", "AVCHD".
        </li>
        <li>
            Video is less than 1.5GB in file size. You may need to adjust the quality settings on your recording device to meet this requirement.
        </li>
        <li>
            The code in the form below is written on the audition letter you received in the mail.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="notice">
        <b>Once you complete the form, press submit and wait until you see the success or failure message before leaving
        the page.<br/> Please have your submission in by 11:59pm on Thursday April 8th.</b>
